# Groceries-since-1-Sep-2022
This spreadsheet contains our grocery purchasing data, collected from the orders and invoices paperwork which we receive via email from a "supplier" such as  PAK'nSAVE, when we place our weekly grocery requests, and receive our weekly purchases. The terminology used here is specific and intentional. Orders relate to "requests", and invoices relate to "purchases". There are also "products", which are stock items that are available for purchase from a supplier. In future additions to this spreadsheet, we will also define those purchases which we have in stock at home, as being "items". An item will therefore be a product which has been requested and purchased, and is now available for consumption within our home. This will allow us to include these items in a "recipe", which in turn can be consumed as part of a "meal", which will be part of a "mealplan". Once an item has been consumed, whether as a food item it is eaten, or as a non-food item it is used up, it will be removed from our items list and disposed of in the "consumed" list. In the longer-term, another advance on this spreadsheet will allow for "nutrients" to be tracked, such as the sugar, salt, and carbohydrate content of a food item, allowing for a measure of our nutrient intake. But that is a way off in the future yet.
